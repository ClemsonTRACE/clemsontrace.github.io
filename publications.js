    "abstract": "The paper reports on two empirical studies that provide the first examination into how the presentation of an AI teammate\u2019s identity, responsibility, and capability impacts humans\u2019 perception surrounding AI teammate adoption before interacting as teammates. Study 1\u2019s results indicated that AI teammates are accepted when they share equal responsibility on a task with humans, but other perceptions such as job security generally decline the more responsibility AI teammates have. Study 1 also revealed that identifying an AI as a tool instead of a teammate can have small benefits to human perceptions of job security and adoption. Study 2 revealed that the negative impacts of increasing responsibility can be mitigated by presenting AI teammates\u2019 capabilities as being endorsed by coworkers and one\u2019s own past experience. This paper discusses how to use these results to best balance the presentation of AI teammates\u00a0\u2026",

    "abstract": "This systematic review provides an understanding of existing human factors research on adaptive autonomy, its design, its impacts, and its definition. We conducted a search on <i>adaptive autonomy</i> and additional relevant search terms in four databases, which produced an initial 245 articles. The application of inclusion and exclusion criteria produced a total of 60 articles for in-depth review. Through a collaborative coding process and analysis, we extracted triggers for and types of autonomy adaptations, as well as human factors dependent variables that have been studied in previous adaptive autonomy research. Based on this analysis, we present a definition of <i>adaptive autonomy</i> for use in human factors artificial intelligence research, as well as a comprehensive review of existing research contributions, notable research gaps, and the application of adaptive autonomy.",

Unfortunately, they lack the normal team formation processes that traditional teams use. Information sharing recommender systems can be used to share information about team members amongst the team; however, these systems rely on the team members themselves to disclose valuable information. While prior research has shown that an effective way to encourage user disclosure is through explanations to the user about what benefits they will gain from disclosure, the timing of such explanations has yet to be consideblack. In a between-subjects study with 150 participants, we assessed the content and timing of explanations on levels of disclosure in temporary teams. Our results indicate that providing benefit-related explanations during the time of disclosure can increase user disclosure, and\u00a0\u2026",

    "abstract": "Whereas high-performance teamwork has been studied empirically for 70 years, a new form of teaming is on the rise. Enabled through the rapid progression of artificial intelligence, a human-autonomy team (HAT) involves one or more autonomous computerized agents collaborating with humans on interdependent tasks toward the achievement of a common goal. Whereas research on HATs is exploding in recent years, that research has not strongly embraced the vast literature, theory, and methods already developed in the all-human teaming literature. Moreover, definitional and construct validity issues, in terms of what constitutes a HAT, persist in the literature. In the current article we offer construct clarity and we integrate the Input-Mediator-Output model from the high-performance teaming literature to help future researchers classify the variables under study, theorize deeper, and consolidate findings across\u00a0\u2026",

However, the differences in communication styles between humans and AI often prevent human teammates from fully understanding the intent and needs of AI teammates. One core difference is that humans naturally leverage a positive emotional tone during communication to convey their confidence or lack thereof to convey doubt in their ability to complete a task. Yet, this communication strategy must be explicitly designed in order for an AI teammate to be human-centered. In this mixed-methods study, 45 participants completed a study examining how human teammates interpret the behaviors of their AI teammates when they express different positive emotions via specific words/phrases.

Given the historic importance of trust within human-agent teams, the identification of etiquette\u2019s impact within said teams should be paramount. Thus, this study empirically evaluates the impact of AI teammate etiquette through a mixed-methods study that compares AI teammates that either adhere to or ignore traditional etiquette standards for machine systems.

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in AI technologies have caused teams to explore the use of AI agents as full, active members of the team. The complex environments that teams occupy require human team members to constantly adapt their behaviors, and thus the ability of AI teammates to similarly adapt to changing situations significantly enhances the team\u2019s chances to succeed. In order to design such agents, it is important that we understand not only how to identify the amount of autonomous control AI agents have over their decisions, but also how changes to this control cognitively affects the rest of the team. Professional organizations often break their work cycles into phases that set limits on the team members\u2019 actions, and we propose that a similar process could be used to define the autonomy levels of AI teammates.

    "abstract": "Alongside the rapid development and progression of AI algorithms, parallel efforts have been made to apply AI algorithms to human-facing systems. Over the last few decades, computational systems have been mostly relegated to automating basic and repetitive tasks alongside humans, thus creating human\u2013automation interaction (Lee &amp; See, 2004). However, the last few years have seen major strides made in artificial intelligence (AI) allowing for more dynamic and complex problems to be solved. What separates the technologies is that automation is often task-oriented and lacks the flexibility to handle changes in the task it was designed for (known as brittleness), but AI has the capability to handle tasks with dynamic features and may even have the potential to handle multiple tasks in a dynamic environment, which also makes it more capable of working alongside humans in these environments (Wynne &amp; Lyons\u00a0\u2026",

    "abstract": "This study improves the understanding of trust in human-AI teams by investigating the relationship of AI teammate ethicality on individual outcomes of trust (ie, monitoring, confidence, fear) in AI teammates and human teammates over time. Specifically, a synthetic task environment was built to support a three-person team with two human teammates and one AI teammate (simulated by a confederate). The AI teammate performed either an ethical or unethical action in three missions, and measures of trust in the human and AI teammate were taken after each mission. Results from the study revealed that unethical actions by the AT had a significant effect on nearly all of the outcomes of trust measured and that levels of trust were dynamic over time for both the AI and human teammate, with the AI teammate recovering trust in Mission 1 levels by Mission 3. AI ethicality was mostly unrelated to participants\u2019 trust in their fellow human teammates but did decrease perceptions of fear, paranoia, and skepticism in them, and trust in the human and AI teammate was not significantly related to individual performance outcomes, which both diverge from previous trust research in human-AI teams utilizing competency-based trust violations.",

In the current study, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with US Air Force pilots on the topics of autonomous teammates, trust, and ethics. A thematic analysis revealed that the pilots see themselves serving a parental role alongside a developing machine teammate. As parents, the pilots would feel responsible for their machine teammate\u2019s behavior, and their unethical actions may not lead to a loss of trust.

This need is centered around the well-known issue of innate mistrust between humans and artificial intelligence, resulting in sub-optimal work. To combat this, computer scientists and humancomputer interaction researchers alike have presented and refined specific solutions to this issue through different methods of AI interpretability. These different methods include explicit AI explanations as well as implicit manipulations of the AI interface, otherwise known as AI transparency.

Given the vast array of philosophical considerations of AI ethics, there is a pressing need to understand and balance public opinion and expectations of how AI ethics should be defined and implemented, such that it centers the voice of experts and non-experts alike. This investigation explores a subreddit r/aiethics through a multi-methodological, multi-level approach. The analysis yields six conversational themes, sentiment trends, and emergent roles that elicit narratives associated with expanding implementation, policy, critical literacy, communal preparedness, and increased awareness towards combining technical and social aspects of AI ethics. Such insights can help to distill necessary considerations for the practice of AI ethics beyond scholarly traditions and how informal spaces (such as virtual channels) can and should act as avenues of learning, raising critical consciousness, bolstering connectivity, and enhancing narrative agency on AI ethics.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have permeated through an array of different immersive environments, including virtual, augmented, and mixed realities. AI brings a wealth of potential that centers on its ability to critically analyze environments, identify relevant artifacts to a goal or action, and then autonomously execute decision-making strategies to optimize the reward-to-risk ratio. However, the inherent benefits of AI are not without disadvantages as the autonomy and communication methodology can interfere with the human's awareness of their environment. More specifically in the case of autonomy, the relevant human-computer interaction literature cites that high autonomy results in an \"out-of-the-loop\" experience for the human such that they are not aware of critical artifacts or situational changes that require their attention. At the same time, low autonomy of an AI system can limit the human's own autonomy with repeated requests to approve its decisions. In these circumstances, humans enter into supervisor roles, which tend to increase their workload and, therefore, decrease their awareness in a multitude of ways. In this position statement, we call for the development of human-centered AI in immersive environments to sustain and promote awareness. It is our position then that we believe with the inherent risk presented in both AI and AR/VR systems, we need to examine the interaction between them when we integrate the two to create a new system for any unforeseen risks, and that it is crucial to do so because of its practical application in many high-risk environments.",

    "abstract": "A growing organizational trend is to utilize ad-hoc team formation which allows for teams to intentionally form based on the member skills required to accomplish a specific task. Due to the unfamiliar nature of these teams, teammates are often limited by their understanding of one another (e.g., teammate preferences, tendencies, attitudes) which limits the team's functioning and efficiency. This study conceptualizes and investigates the use of a teammate information-sharing recommender system which selectively shares interpersonal recommendations between unfamiliar teammates (e.g., \"Your voice may be overshadowed by this teammate when making decisions...\") to promote teammate understanding.

Specifically, we present an LLM-based Smart Reply (LSR) system utilizing the ChatGPT to generate personalized responses in professional collaborative scenarios while adapting to context and communication style based on prior responses. Our two-step process involves generating a preliminary response type (eg, Agree, Disagree) to provide a generalized direction for message generation, thus reducing response drafting time. We conducted an experiment where participants completed simulated work tasks involving a Dual N-back test and subtask scheduling through Google Calendar while interacting with co-workers. Our findings indicate that the proposed LSR reduces overall workload, as measured by the NASA TLX, and improves work performance and productivity in the N-back task. We also provide qualitative analysis based on participants\u2019 experiences, as well as design considerations to provide future directions for improving such implementations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a bottom-up approach to designing and developing a high-fidelity simulation environment that fosters human acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) as teammates by refining their mental models of appropriate teamwork expectations. Our process begins by first identifying an appropriate contextual situation that warrants humans teaming with AI as opposed to other team-based configurations. Those criteria are based on the delegation of roles appropriate to the established strengths of humans/AI, as well as the interdependence created between those roles to accentuate the expectations of teammate behavior. Next, qualitative interviews should be conducted with diverse subject matter experts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the environmental attributes through various perspectives.

Many of these applications include the creation of human-artificial intelligence (AI) teams, which promise to increase the already known advantages of working in team environments. The efficacy of the AI agents that make up these teams has always been a significant focus. However, a shift from technical ability to social abilities has occurred. A newfound emphasis on trust within these human-AI teams has prompted research on supporting trust between humans and AI teammates, how AI affects trust between the humans within the team, and how team composition (majority AI versus majority human) influences trust development. Even the efficacy of trust repair strategies, adapted from human-automation interaction, is being explored in human-AI teaming. In the current paper, we examine an essential component of trust that has yet to receive requisite attention: the spread of trust within and across constellations of teams. To this end, we discuss the potential impacts of trust within and across human-AI teams and constellations on team efficacy. From this discussion, several challenges are proposed in five major research questions that should be addressed to enable more effective human-AI teams and human-AI teaming constellations.", "issued": {"date-parts":[["2022"]]}},

While human-AI collaboration has been investigated in various domains, more research is needed to explore human perceptions and expectations of AI teammates in human-AI teaming. To achieve an in-depth understanding of how people perceive AI teammates and what they expect from AI teammates in human-AI teaming, we conducted a survey with 213 participants and a follow-up interview with 20 participants. Considering the context-dependency of teamwork, we chose to study human-AI teaming in the context of multiplayer online games as a case study. This study shows that people have mixed feelings toward AI teammates but hold a positive attitude toward future collaboration with AI teammates in general. Our findings highlight people's expectations for AI teammates in a rapidly changing collaborative environment (e.g., instrumental skills for in-game tasks, shared understanding between humans and AI, communication capabilities, human-like behaviors and performance), as well as factors that impact people's willingness to team up with AI teammates (e.g., pre-existing attitudes toward AI, previous collaboration experience with humans). We contribute to CSCW by shedding light on how AI should be structured in human-AI teaming to support highly complex collaborative activities in CSCW environments.",

Results show that (1) there are lower levels of trust in the autonomous agent in low-performing teams compared with medium- or high-performing teams; (2) there is a loss of trust in the autonomous agent over time across low-, medium-, and high-performing teams; and (3) both low- and medium-performing teams indicated lower levels of trust in their human team members.

They have increasingly become emerging sites where non-professional game developers, amateurs, and hobbyists engage in bottom-up technological innovation by collaboratively designing and developing more creative and novel digital products. Drawing on 28 interviews, in this paper we focus on how game developers collaborate as small teams to innovate game design and development from the bottom up in virtual game jams (i.e., exclusively online) and the unique role of virtual game jams in their technological innovation. We contribute to CSCW by providing new empirical evidence of how team practices for innovation may emerge in a novel technology community that is not widely studied before. We also expand a growing research agenda in CSCW on explicating nuanced social behaviors, processes, and consequences of bottom-up technological innovation.",

However, little research has focused on applying such an important teamwork process to computer-mediated collaboration within a fast-paced virtual environment. In this paper, we use esports as a research platform to address this limitation due to its fast-paced nature and its heavy reliance on teamwork. We report the experience and perceptions of 20 players with regard to their descriptions of team cognition within esports. We found that esports players relied on their game experience and understanding of role interdependencies in order to develop team cognition with strangers. We also found that experienced teams utilized a mutual understanding of teammate skills and personalities in order to predict responses and limit the verbal communication required to make quick team decisions. We contribute to CSCW by extending the cognitive understanding of computer-mediated collaboration and by advancing research on team cognition and how it can occur within a fast-paced virtual environment.",

		"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to understand the communication among care teams during telemedicine-enabled stroke consults in an ambulance.\nBACKGROUND: Telemedicine can have a significant impact on acute stroke care by enabling timely intervention in an ambulance before a patient reaches the hospital. However, limited research has been conducted on understanding and supporting team communication during the care delivery process for telemedicine-enabled stroke care in an ambulance.\nMETHOD: Video recordings of 13 simulated stroke telemedicine consults conducted in an ambulance were coded to document the tasks, communication events, and flow disruptions during the telemedicine-enabled stroke care delivery process.\nRESULTS: The majority (82%) of all team interactions in telemedicine-enabled stroke care involved verbal interactions among team members. The neurologist, patient, and paramedic were almost equally involved in team interactions during stroke care, though the neurologist initiated 48% of all verbal interactions. Disruptions were observed in 8% of interactions, and communication-related issues contributed to 44%, with interruptions and environmental hazards being other reasons for disruptions in interactions during telemedicine-enabled stroke care.\nCONCLUSION: Successful telemedicine-enabled stroke care involves supporting both verbal and nonverbal communication among all team members using video and audio systems to provide effective coverage of the patient for the clinicians as well as vice versa.\nAPPLICATION: This study provides a deeper understanding of team interactions during telemedicine-enabled stroke care that is essential for designing effective systems to support teamwork.",

		"abstract": "Past research has established that telemedicine improves stroke care through decreased time to treatment and more accurate diagnoses. The goals of this study were to 1) study how clinicians complete stroke assessment using a telemedicine system integrated in ambulances, 2) determine potential errors and usability issues when using the system, and 3) develop recommendations to mitigate these issues. This study investigated use of a telemedicine platform to evaluate a stroke patient in an ambulance with a geographically distributed caregiving team comprised of a paramedic, nurse, and neurologist. It first determined the tasks involved based on 13 observations of a simulated stroke using 39 care providers. Based on these observational studies, a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) was developed, and subsequently, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to determine the usability issues in the interface of the telemedicine system. This was followed by a Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach (SHERPA) to determine the possibility of human error while providing care using the telemedicine work system. The results from the HTA included 6 primary subgoals categorizing the 97 tasks to complete the stroke evaluation. The heuristic evaluation found 123 unique violations to heuristics, with an average severity of 2.38. One hundred and thirty-one potential human errors were found with SHERPA, the two most common being miscommunication and selecting an incorrect option. Several recommendations are proposed, including improvement of labeling, consistent formatting, rigid or suggested formatting for data input, automation of task structure and camera movement, and audio/visual improvements to support communication.",

This paper outlines an experimental research study that investigates essential aspects of human-AI teaming such as team performance, team situation awareness, and perceived team cognition in various mixed composition teams (human-only, human-human-AI, human-AI-AI, and AI-only) through a simulated emergency response management scenario. Results indicate dichotomous outcomes regarding perceived team cognition and performance metrics, as perceived team cognition was not predictive of performance. Performance metrics like team situational awareness and team score showed that teams composed of all human participants performed at a lower level than mixed human-AI teams, with the AI-only teams attaining the highest performance. Perceived team cognition was highest in human-only teams, with mixed composition teams reporting perceived team cognition 58% below the all-human teams. These results inform future mixed teams of the potential performance gains in utilizing mixed teams' over human-only teams in certain applications, while also highlighting mixed teams' adverse effects on perceived team cognition.",

Specifically, team situation awareness (TSA) and team conflict are examined in human–machine teams. There is a significant need to identify how TSA and team conflict occur during human–machine teaming, in addition to how they impact each other. In this work, we present an experiment aimed at understanding TSA and team conflict in the context of human–machine teaming in a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Three conditions were tested: (1) control: teams consisted of all humans; (2) synthetic: teams consisted of the pilot role being occupied by a computational agent based on ACT-R architecture that employed AI capabilities, with all other team roles being humans; and (3) experimenter: an experimenter playing the role of the pilot as a highly effective computational agent, with the other roles being humans. The results indicate that TSA improved over time in synthetic teams, improved and then stabilized over time in experimenter teams, and did not improve in control teams. In addition, results show that control teams had the most team conflict. Finally, in the control condition, team conflict negatively impacts TSA.",

		"abstract": "This study explored seven engineering graduate students’ collaborative problem-solving (CPS) skills while working in interdisciplinary teams. Students worked in two different teams, in face-to-face and online environments, to solve complex manufacturing design challenges posed by their instructor. The students were assessed using an observational rubric with four dimensions: peer interactions, positive communication, tools and methods and iteration and adaption, and scored via each dimension’s associated attributes, and subsequently interviewed. Six students scored emergent or proficient in CPS and had slightly higher CPS scores during the second observation. One student demonstrated a limited ability for CPS and the observable CPS skills decreased during the project. Interviews revealed the importance of (1) relying on instructor and student chosen technologies for collaborative tasks, (2) recognising and drawing on peer expertise early in the project, (3) building trust during and outside of team meetings and (4) valuing off-site and online collaborative work. Findings advance the understanding of how graduate students working in interdisciplinary teams rely on particular features of collaboration to solve engineering design challenges, which may assist in developing future skills and fostering productive teamwork.",

This advancement is driving new research investigations into the applicability of human-human teamwork knowledge to the context of human-autonomy teaming. In the current study, we apply qualitative methods to explore how the perceived composition of a team (how many humans and how many agents on the team) affects sentiments toward teammates, team processes, cognitive states, and the emergence of a system of team cognition. A total of 46 teams completed a teamwork simulation task and were interviewed afterwards regarding their teamwork experience. All of the teams were comprised of only humans; however, two conditions were led to believe that their teammate(s) were autonomous agents. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory and the Gioia methodology, which revealed thematic differences between the team compositions. In light of our results, we offer a new model that describes how early-stage action teams achieve effective team processes and emergent cognitive states.",

This study sought to examine the effects of three different training approaches on team communication behaviors in human-autonomy teams (HATs) under normal and degraded conditions. Teams were split into three conditions prior to execution of missions in a remotely piloted aircraft system task environment: coordination training, calibration training, and control training. Analysis of text communications indicated that teams that received coordination training push information more frequently compared to teams that received control or calibration training, though this effect appeared to diminish over time. Teams in all three conditions pulled information equally, with a reduction in frequency over time. It was also found that teams that received coordination training were more likely to overcome failures attributed to the autonomous agent's cognitive capacities. This research suggests that coordination training in HATs may be effective at influencing team verbal behaviors, however the extent of this effect requires further examination.",

These models are used to train artificial agents to then interact alongside humans in a human-autonomy team. The framework was synthesized from experience gained redesigning a previously known and validated team task simulation environment known as NeoCITIES. Through this redesign, several important high-level distinctions were made that regarded both the artificial agent and the task simulation itself. The distinctions within the framework include gamification, access to high-performance computing, a proper reward function, an appropriate team task simulation, and customizability. This framework enables researchers to create experiments that are more usable for the human and more closely resemble real-world human-autonomy interactions. The framework also allows researchers to create veritable and robust experimental platforms meant to study human-autonomy teaming for years to come.",

		"abstract": "Teacher-agent teams have the potential to increase instructional effectiveness in diverse classrooms. The agent can be trained on previous student assessment data to create a model for assessing student performance and provide instructional recommendations. We propose a conceptual model that outlines how assessment agents can be trained for and used in classrooms to create effective teacher-agent teams. Furthermore, we show how teacher-agent teams can assist in the implementation of differentiated instruction, a strategy which allows teachers to effectively instruct students of diverse backgrounds and understandings. Differentiated instruction is further realized by having an assessment agent focus on grading student work, providing feedback to students, categorizing students, and giving recommendations for instruction so that teachers can focus on providing individualized or small group instruction to diverse learners. This model maximizes the strengths of teachers, while minimizing the tedious tasks that teachers routinely perform.",

Unfortunately, the digital nature of artificial teammates and their restrictive communication and coordination requirements complicate the interaction patterns that exist. In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.",

		"abstract": "For years, researchers have demonstrated the viability and applicability of game theory principles to the field of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, game theory has been shown as a useful tool for researching human-machine interaction, specifically their cooperation, by creating an environment where cooperation can initially form before reaching a continuous and stable presence in a human-machine system. Additionally, recent developments in reinforcement learning artificial intelligence have led to artificial agents cooperating more efficiently with humans, especially in more complex environments. This research conducts an empirical study to understand how different modern reinforcement learning algorithms and game theory scenarios could create different cooperation levels in human-machine teams. Three different reinforcement learning algorithms (Vanilla Policy Gradient, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Deep Q-Network) and two different game theory scenarios (Hawk Dove and Prisoners dilemma) were examined in a large-scale experiment. The results indicated that different reinforcement learning models interact differently with humans with Deep-Q engendering higher cooperation levels. The Hawk Dove game theory scenario elicited significantly higher levels of cooperation in the human-artificial intelligence system. A multiple regression using these two independent variables also found a significant ability to predict cooperation in the human-artificial intelligence systems. The results highlight the importance of social and task framing in human-artificial intelligence systems and noted the importance of choosing reinforcement learning models.",

      "Much HCI research seeks to contribute to technological agendas that lead to more just and participative labor relations and practices, yet that research also raises concerns about forms of exploitation associated with them. In this paper, we explore how U.S. independent [indie] game developers' socio-technological practices inject forms of labor, capital, and production into the game development industry. Our findings highlight that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and 3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools and middleware make game production more widely accessible. The research contributes to HCI research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes. Our critical review of indie developers' practices and strategies also extends the current conceptualization of labor and technology in CSCW.",

      "As robots become more autonomous, their roles shift from being operated and controlled by humans to interactively teaming with humans. The current research focuses on how human operators can effectively team with autonomous urban search and rescue agents in a dynamic and complex task environment. To do so, we empirically examined how shared cognition and restricted language capabilities impacted performance of human-robot dyad search teams using a simulated Minecraft task environment. In order to examine the effects of shared mental models and language the following modified conditions were applied: (1) participants were either able to communicate using natural language or the internal participant's communication was limited to three-word utterances; and (2) shared mental models were manipulated by either the internal participant being made fully aware of the external participant's restricted representation of the environment and inaccurate map or the internal was unaware of these challenges. The primary findings from this study are: (1) teams in the natural language and shared mental model conditions performed better than teams in the limited language and restricted model conditions; (2) when the internal participant was unaware of the challenges of the external, the external perceived higher workload than when there was a shared mental model; (3) teams with natural language and shared mental model demonstrated more predictable behavior than the other teams; (4) some amount of systems’ predictability was good but too much predictability was not good. Overall, these results indicate that effective team interaction and shared cognition play an important role in human-robot dyadic teaming performance.",

      'The phenomenon of end-user driven technological practices such as DIY making, hacking, crafting, and open design/manufacturing is shaping debates in HCI and CSCW about participatory innovation dynamics. However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users\' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face, therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists\' and experts\' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven technological practices.',

In this paper, we outline previous work that has highlighted multiple aspects of AI-safety research and focus on AI-safety systems in multi-agent systems. After overviewing previous literature, we present a model focused on flash crashes, a concept often found in economics. The model was constructed using an interdisciplinary approach that includes game theory, machine learning, cognitive science and systems theory to study flash crashes in complex human-AI systems. We use the model to study a complex interaction between AI-agents, and our results indicate the multi-agent system in question is prone to cause flash crashes.',

      'With multi-agent teams becoming more of a reality every day, it is important to create a common design model for multi-agent teams. These teams need to be able to function in dynamic environments and still communicate with any humans that may need a problem solved. Existing human-agent research can be used to purposefully create multi-agent teams that are interdependent but can still interact with humans. Rather than creating dynamic agents, the most effective way to overcome the dynamic nature of modern workloads is to create a dynamic team configuration, rather than individual member-agents that can change their roles. Multi-agent teams will require a variety of agents to be designed to cover a diverse subset of problems that need to be solved in the modern workforce. A model based on existing multi-agent teams that satisfies the needs of human-agent teams has been created to serve as a baseline for human-interactive multi-agent teams.',

      'There is an ever-growing literature on the power of prediction markets to harness “the wisdom of the crowd” from large groups of people. However, traditional prediction markets are not designed in a human-centered way, often restricting their own potential. This creates the opportunity to implement a cognitive science perspective on how to enhance the collective intelligence of the participants. Thus, we propose a new model for prediction markets that integrates human factors, cognitive science, game theory and machine learning to maximize collective intelligence. We do this by first identifying the connections between prediction markets and collective intelligence, to then use human factors techniques to analyze our design, culminating in the practical ways with which our design enables artificial intelligence to complement human intelligence.',

      'Project overviewTeam resilience is an interactive and dynamic process that develops over time while a team maintains performance. This study aims to empirically investigate systems-level resilience in a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) System simulated task environment by examining team interaction during novel events. The approach used in the current study to measure systems-level resilience was developed by Hoffman  in our case, that is applied to Human-Autonomy Teams (HATs). Hoffman and Hancock conceptualized a resilience measure dynamically by means of several components, such as the time it took the system to recognize and characterize anomalies, and the time taken to specify and achieve new goals. In their framework, there were two main sub-events which expressed resilience via time-based measures, and upon which we designed ours in this study: (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman  (2) pilot ? controlled the RPA by adjusting its altitude and airspeed through negotiating with the photographer in order to take a good photo of the target waypoints; and (3) photographer ? screened camera settings and sent feedback to the other team members regarding the status of target?s photograph. This study followed the Wizard of Oz paradigm wherein the navigator and photographer were seated together in one room and were told that the pilot was a synthetic agent. In actuality, the pilot was a well-trained experimenter who was working from a separate room. This ?synthetic? pilot used restricted vocabulary to simulate that of a computer. The main manipulations in this study consisted of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure - role-level display failures while processing specific targets, (2) autonomy failure - autonomous agent behaved abnormally while processing specific targets (i.e., it provided misinformation to other team members or demonstrated incorrect actions), and (3) malicious cyber-attacks - the hijacking of the synthetic agent, which led to the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information to the team about the RPA destination. Because the malicious cyber-attack only occurred once (during the final mission), we will focus on the automation and autonomy failures for this study. Each failure was imposed at a selected target waypoint and the teams had to find a solution in a limited amount of time. The time limit for each failure was related to the difficulty of the failure. Each failure was introduced at a pre-selected target waypoint for each team.MethodIn this experiment, there were 22 teams, with only two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles for each team, because the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter. The current task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions in which teams needed to take as many ?good? photos as possible of ground targets while avoiding alarms and rule violations. For this study, using the RPAS paradigm, we calculated two team resilience scores (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman  (2) autonomy failures took more time for human teammates to identify the failure, because the autonomous agent?s abnormal behavior was not as straight forward; and 3) human teammates overtrusted to the autonomous agent and lack confidence in themselves and let the failure go on.AcknowledgementsThis research is supported by ONR Award N000141712382 (Program Managers: Marc Steinberg, Micah Clark). We also acknowledge the assistance of Steven M. Shope of Sandia Research Corporation, who integrated the synthetic agent and the testbed.',

      'Project OverviewTeam Situation Awareness (TSA), which is a part of team cognition, is a critical factor that influences team effectiveness. It can be defined as getting the right information from the right person within the right amount of time, in order to overcome an unexpected event (Gorman, Cooke, Pederson, Connor,  (2) the pilot, who controls the RPA?s heading, altitude, and airspeed, and negotiates with the photographer in order to take a good photo; and (3) the photographer, who monitors sensor equipment in order to take photographs of target waypoints and sends feedback to the other team members about the quality of the photo. This project aimed to understand how team behaviors and team performance differed between HATs and all-human teams in RPAS operations: (1) the synthetic condition?the pilot role was given to the synthetic teammate, which was an ACT-R based cognitive model (which had a limited interaction ability, see Ball et al., 2010; Demir et al., 2015); (2) the control condition?the pilot was a randomly selected human participant, just like the other two participants; and (3) the experimenter condition?one of the experimenters served as an expert pilot. Experimenter condition utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm in which a trained experimenter (located in a separate room) used a script to imitate a synthetic teammate and communicated with participants in limited communication behaviors but pushing and pulling information in a timely manner (robust coordination).MethodThere were 30 teams (10 for each condition): control teams consisted of three participants randomly assigned to each role; synthetic and experimenter teams included two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. The experiment took place over five 40-minute missions, and the goal was to take as many ?good? photos of ground targets as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. During each mission, teams were presented with ?roadblocks? by the introduction of a new, ad hoc target waypoint. We collected several measures, but we focused on: the proportion of roadblocks overcome per mission as an outcome measure of TSA; the CAST which is a coordination sequence of team interaction across the team members (i.e. which team members share with team members their experience during the roadblock); and verbal behaviors such as pushing and pulling information.Results and discussionIn this team task, effective teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates, which in turn means pushing information before it is requested. However, in addition to anticipation, effective coordination is also needed during roadblocks. HATs demonstrated significantly lower levels of CAST than all-human teams. These results indicate that HATs? lack of anticipation and coordination resulted in poorer TSA performance. These findings help HATs to grow its coordination and communication methodologies. Finally, future studies might examine the relationships highlighted in this study via nonlinear measures in terms of team stability and flexibility based on their communication and coordination patterns during the novel events. HAT is here to stay but improvements to human-machine interactions must continue if we are to improve team effectiveness.',

      'Teamwork can be defined as dynamic team interaction between two or more interdependent members to achieve a shared goal. Many studies have examined how coordination dynamics are associated with team effectiveness in the context of all-human teams (Gorman, Amazeen, & Cooke, 2010), and later, in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s (Demir, Likens, Cooke, Amazeen, & McNeese, 2018). HATs must have autonomous agents that act as effective teammates and help enable HATs to function as collaborative systems. Synergistic relationships among a system’s human and technological components provide the basis for emergent systems-level outcomes. Layered dynamics, a recent empirical modelling technique aimed at achieving this objective (Gorman et al., 2019), considers reorganization of the sociotechnical system across individual components and the overall system. The current study examined layered dynamics of HATs during automation and autonomy failures and addresses how members of HATs interact with each other and technological aspects of the system.',

      'In future urban search and rescue teams, robots may be expected to conduct cognitive tasks. As the capabilities of robots change, so too will their interdependence with human teammates. Human factors and cognitive engineering are well-positioned to guide the design of autonomy for effective teaming. Previous work in the urban search and rescue synthetic task environment (USAR-STE) used Minecraft, a customizable gaming platform. In this effort, we advanced the USAR-STE by increasing interdependence in dyadic human-robot teaming through the Coactive Design framework. In this framework, we defined required capacities of victim identification in USAR from literature, and used them as inputs for modeling interdependence, and determined recommendations that would enhance interdependence in the task environment. Although Coactive Design is typically used to design interdependence for robots or jobs, we demonstrated how it can also be used to design an experimental team task environment.',

      'The emergence of various interest-based online communities has led to the popularity of new forms of distributed creative teamwork such as citizen science, crowdsourcing, and open source software development. These new phenomena further complicate the context and content of distributed creative teamwork: what are the characteristics of these new forms of creative teams? And how do they shape people’s perceptions and social experiences of distributed creative teams? In this paper, we report our empirical research of the team characteristics and practices in a creativity-centric technology community (i.e., independent [indie] game development) in hopes of exploring these questions. Our findings show that 1) indie game development teams are formed upon shared aspirations and use various strategies to collaborate with friends or online strangers; and their team practices are achieved through a balance between individual creativity and collective vision as well as a collaborative learning for problem solving and self-improvement; and 2) these teams mediate new forms of social interaction and collaborative experiences, featuring a mix of online comradery and weak social ties, and a mix of self-confidence and self-confliction. Using this new dataset and research context, we confirm and extend existing theories of distributed creative teams in CSCW. We also argue that studying these small-scale, self-selected, and interest-based teams can inform the design of collaborative systems to support various creative teams’ social needs.',

      'The aim of this exploratory paper is to underline the importance of coordination-based training for dynamic tasks in human-autonomy teaming. We address training solutions to distinct types of failures caused by either internal (the system) and external sources (the dynamic task environment). In order to accomplish this, we explore Human-Autonomy teaming communication and coordination with comprehensive scenarios drawn from the pilot tests and look at team needs to successfully overcome complex and dynamic failures. Findings from these two failure events are two-fold: (1) in order to adapt to dynamic environments and overcome unexpected failures, teams should receive role-related training (static and knowledge-based) as well as training about how to interact with one another (dynamic and coordination-based) and (2) designing synthetic agents with effective team coordination mechanisms will help future team training exercises. Current and future work is focused on additional experimentation on team training in the context of Human-Autonomy teams. Furthermore, future experimentation should highlight additional requirements needed for designing synthetic teammates and also dynamic task training necessary to produce effective teamwork.',

      'In this paper, we explore a network of distributed individuals’ collective efforts to establish an innovation ecology allowing them to engage in bottom up creative technological practices in today’s information society. Specifically, we present an empirical study of the technological practices in an emerging creative technology community – independent [indie] game developers in the United States. Based on indie game developers’ own accounts, we identified four themes that constitute an innovation ecology from the bottom up, including problem solving; collaborative information seeking, sharing, and reproducing; community support; and policy and politics. We argue that these findings inform our understanding of bottom up technological innovation and shed light on the design of sociotechnical systems to mediate and support such innovation beyond the gaming context.',

Specific focuses of the study were team performance and team social behaviors (specifically trust) of human-autonomy teams. Results indicate 1) that there are lower levels of trust in the autonomous agent in low performing teams than both medium and high performing teams, 2) there is a loss of trust in the autonomous agent across low, medium, and high performing teams over time, and 3) that in addition to the human team members indicating low levels of trust in the autonomous agent, both low and medium performing teams also indicated lower levels of trust in their human team members.',

      'The focus of this current research is two-fold: (1) to understand how team interaction in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s evolve in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) task context, and (2) to understand how HATs respond to three types of failures (automation, autonomy, and cyber-attack) over time. We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams. In the third experiment, which extends beyond the first two experiments, we investigate HAT evolution when HATs are faced with three types of failures during the task. For all three of these experiments, measures focus on team interactions and temporal dynamics consistent with the theory of interactive team cognition. We applied Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis, to communication flow in the three experiments. One of the most interesting and significant findings from our experiments regarding team evolution is the idea of entrainment, that one team member (the pilot in our study, either agent or human) can change the communication behaviors of the other teammates over time, including coordination, and affect team performance. In the first and second studies, behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams resulted in very stable and rigid coordination in comparison to the all-human teams that were less stable. Experimenter teams demonstrated metastable coordination (not rigid nor unstable) and performed better than rigid and unstable teams during the dynamic task. In the third experiment, metastable behavior helped teams overcome all three types of failures. These summarized findings address three potential future needs for ensuring effective HAT: (1) training of autonomous agents on the principles of teamwork, specifically understanding tasks and roles of teammates, (2) human-centered machine learning design of the synthetic agent so the agents can better understand human behavior and ultimately human needs, and (3) training of human members to communicate and coordinate with agents due to current limitations of Natural Language Processing of the agents.',

      'In the past, team coordination dynamics have been explored using nonlinear dynamical systems (NDS) methods, but the relationship between team coordination dynamics and team performance for all-human teams was assumed to be linear. The current study examines team coordination dynamics with an extended version of the NDS methods and assumes that its relationship with team performance for human-autonomy teams (HAT) is nonlinear. In this study, three team conditions are compared with the goals of better understanding how team coordination dynamics differ between all-human teams and HAT and how these dynamics relate to team performance and team situation awareness. Each condition was determined based on manipulation of the .pilot role: in the first condition (synthetic) the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, in the second condition (control) it was a randomly assigned participant, and in the third condition (experimenter) it was an expert who used a role specific coordination script. NDS indices revealed that synthetic teams were rigid, followed by experimenter teams, who were metastable, and control teams, who were unstable. Experimenter teams demonstrated better team effectiveness (i.e., better team performance and team situation awareness) than control and synthetic teams. Team coordination stability is related to team performance and team situation awareness in anonlinear manner with optimal performance and situation awareness associated with metastability coupled with flexibility. This result means that future development of synthetic teams should address these coordination dynamics, specifically, rigidity in coordination.',

      "Project overview. The current research aims to understand how human operators effectively team with urban search robot teammates in a dynamic and complex task environment. With that in mind, we examined how shared cognition and restricted language capabilities impact performance of human dyadic teams using a simulated Minecraft task environment. In this human dyadic team, an internal teammate (comparable to robot) identifies the location of victims while navigating inside a game environment that reflects a collapsed building; and an external teammate (comparable to operator) sees their teammate's actions from a different screen and guides them through the environment, tracking the location of victims on a map as they go. In order to examine the effects of language and shared cognition, a two by two design was chosen: (1) in the communication manipulation, participants are either able to communicate using natural language or the internal participant’s communication is limited to three-word utterances; and (2) in the shared cognition manipulation, either the internal participant is made fully aware of the external participant’s restricted representation of the environment and inaccurate map or the internal is unaware of these challenges., Method. This study used a simulated search task, in the Minecraft gaming environment, where two humans acted as a human-robot search team (Bartlett & Cooke, 2015). After signing consent forms, two randomly selected participants completed a half-hour training session for their individual role. Both participants sat in the same room but had a divider between them, and then, interacted to complete a 15-minute simulated search task. The Minecraft environment resembled an office structure with interspersed green, blue, and pink blocks that represented potential targets. Blue and green blocks were meant to represent survivors, whereas pink blocks represented hazards. Pressing a button on green blocks counted positively towards the team’s performance, whereas pressing a button on pink blocks counted negatively towards the team’s performance. Blue blocks were time-sensitive, such that pressing a button on them before eight minutes into the scenario counted positively toward performance, but pressing the button after that time counted against performance. Pressing the button on any block more than once counted negatively towards the team’s performance. A map of this environment was also made available. Inconsistencies were intentionally introduced, such as missing walls, additional walls, and misplaced doorways to simulate a damaged building, none of which were depicted on the map. Due to the dynamic nature of the task, effective communication and coordination between the dyads is required for effective performance. Several measures were obtained in this research: team performance, situation awareness, NASA TLX workload, team verbal behaviors, team communication flow, and demographics. In the interest of space, we only present team performance, a determinism measure (served as an index of flexible behavior and was estimated from team communication flow, using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (Marwan, Carmen Romano, Thiel, & Kurths, 2007), and NASA TLX workload., Results and conclusion. The primary findings from this study are that: 1) teams in the natural language and shared model conditions, performed better than teams with the limited language and restricted model, respectively; 2) when the internal participant is unaware of the challenges of the external, the external perceives higher workload than when there is a shared cognition; 3) teams with natural language and shared model demonstrated more predictable behavior than the other teams; 4) some amount of systems predictability is good but too much predictability is not good in the system – this also confirms another study: Demir, Likens, Cooke, Amazeen, & McNeese, InReview. Overall these results indicate that effective team interaction and shared cognition play an important role in human-robot teaming performance., Acknowledgements.

      'Healthcare practitioners today find themselves confronting a multitude of diverse and complex tasks while under time-sensitive conditions. This dynamic is particularly apparent in the operating room, where for each operation, doctors and nurses have to make sure each surgery condition is optimal to avoid surgery complications and the spread of infections. Checklists are a helpful tool to avoid glossing over these critical steps, but their current implementation is outdated and does not leverage human-centered technology. We propose a checklist design for operating rooms that is generated by an intelligent system and is interacted with through a voice interface. By removing this burden away from the nursing staff, routine safety procedures can be expedited, and practitioners can redirect their full attention to the operation at hand.',

      'Internet technologies have created unprecedented opportunities for people to come together and through their collective effort generate large amounts of data about human behavior. With the increased popularity of grounded theory, many researchers have sought to use ever-increasingly large datasets to analyze and draw patterns about social dynamics. However, the data is simply too big to enable a single human to derive effective models for many complex social phenomena. Computational methods offer a unique opportunity to analyze a wide spectrum of sociological events by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Within the human factors community, machine learning has emerged as the dominant AI-approach to deal with big data. However, along with its many benefits, machine learning has introduced a unique challenge: interpretability. The models of macro-social behavior generated by AI are so complex that rarely can they translated into human understanding. We propose a new method to conduct grounded theory research by leveraging the power of machine learning to analyze complex social phenomena through social network analysis while retaining interpretability as a core feature.',

      "Adaptive complex team behaviors evolve dynamically and occur in many different environments. In this study, we examined the role of these behaviors and their relationship with team performance in the context of human-autonomy teams (HAT) and all-human teams. The HAT served as the “synthetic” condition in which two human team members were informed that the third team member was a “synthetic” agent; in the control condition, the team members were informed that the pilot was a remotely located human teammate. Following are the primary findings from this study: first, control teams demonstrated better performance than the synthetic teams; second, control teams were more active than the synthetic teams in terms of planning the task, and third, the behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams (due to lack of planning) associated with diminished team performance. This suggests that the synthetic teams did not show enough adaptive complex behaviors that were evident in control teams. This finding implies that merely believing the pilot to be a synthetic agent made it more difficult for synthetic teams to plan and, thus, effectively anticipate their teammates' needs. In addition, this study highlights that there is a significant need for humans to gain experience in working with a synthetic agent to overcome negative perceptions.",

      'ObjectiveThree different team configurations are compared with the goal of better understanding human-autonomy teaming (HAT).BackgroundAlthough an extensive literature on human-automation interaction exists, much less is known about HAT in which humans and autonomous agents interact as coordinated units. Further research must be conducted to better understand how all-human teams compare to HAT.MethodsIn an unmanned aerial system (UAS) context, a comparison was made among three types of three-member teams: (1) synthetic teams in which the pilot role is assigned to a synthetic teammate, (2) control teams in which the pilot was an inexperienced human, and (3) experimenter teams in which an experimenter served as an experienced pilot. Ten of each type of team participated. Measures of team performance, target processing efficiency, team situation awareness, and team verbal behaviors were analyzed.ResultsSynthetic teams performed as well at the mission level as control (all human) teams but processed targets less efficiently. Experimenter teams performed better across all other measures compared to control and synthetic teams.ConclusionThough there is potential for a synthetic agent to function as a full-fledged teammate, further advances in autonomy are needed to improve team-level dynamics in HAT teams.ApplicationThis research contributes to our understanding of how to make autonomy a good team player.',

      'Effective team communication, a fundamental part of team coordination, is crucial for both effective Team Situation Awareness (TSA) and team performance. In this study, we looked at the role that team interaction (i.e., more specifically team verbal behaviors) played in TSA and team performance in order to better understand Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). We first analyzed team verbal behaviors (i.e., pushing and pulling information) across conditions of human-autonomy teams and human-human teams, and then analyzed their relationship with TSA and team performance via Growth Curve Modelling (GCM). Good teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates and that means pushing information before it is requested. Therefore, if things are going well, there should be little need for pulling information. In this study’s task, participants were instructed to push information to others, and over time master the specific timing of information sharing to the intended recipient. Findings indicate that pushing information was positively associated with TSA and team performance, and human-autonomy teams had lower levels of both pushing and pulling information than all-human teams. Through this study, we have learned that anticipation of other team member behaviors and information requirements in human-autonomy teams are important for effective TSA and team performance. In order to make HAT more effective in terms of teamwork, we need to develop mechanisms to enhance pushing information within HAT.',

      'Project overview. The current study focuses on the nature of team coordination dynamics within all-human teams and Human-Autonomy Teams (HAT) in the context of the development of a fully-fledged synthetic agent that is a computational cognitive model for a three-agent Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) ground crew. In this study, the relationship between team coordination dynamics and team performance within the HAT and all-human teams is considered. To serve as a teammate, the synthetic agent must be able to communicate and coordinate with its human teammates in a constructive and timely manner (Demir, McNeese, & Cooke, 2016). In this current research, there were three heterogeneous team members who communicated via a text-based communication system to photograph target waypoints. Each team member had a different role: (1) navigator – provides information regarding a flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions of each waypoint; (2) pilot – controls the UAS by adjusting its altitude and airspeed by negotiating with the photographer to take a good photo for the target waypoints; and (3) photographer – screens camera settings, and sends feedback to the other team members regarding the status of target’s photograph. At each target waypoint, this coordination sequence among the team members, called Information-Negotiation-Feedback (INF), is captured by a Kappa Score (Gorman, Amazeen, & Cooke, 2010) that describes the sequence and timing of the information coordination. Three conditions were created that manipulated the pilot role: (1) Synthetic – pilot was the synthetic agent, (2) Control – pilot was a randomly assigned participant, and (3) Experimenter – pilot was an experimenter who was highly experienced with the task and focused on pushing and pulling the information in a timely manner., Method. In this experiment, there were 30 teams (ten teams for each condition): control teams were composed of three participants randomly assigned to each role; synthetic and experimenter teams were composed of only two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. The experiment consisted of five missions (each 40 minutes) in which teams needed to take as many “good” photos as possible of ground targets while avoiding alarms and rule violations. Several measures were obtained from this research, including team performance scores (mission and target level), team process measures (situation awareness, process ratings, communication and coordination), and other measures (teamwork knowledge, workload, and demographics). The research reported here identifies how differences in team coordination, captured by Kappa, relate to performance of all human teams and HAT teams. In this paper, we focus on: (1) target level team performance scores calculated based on the time spent inside a target waypoint to get a good photo; and (2) two team coordination dynamics measures: stability and team communication determinism. Stability was inversely related to the largest Lyapunov Exponent which was estimated by Kappa, that is, the INF coordination sequence. Team communication determinism was estimated from communication data using Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis (Marwan, Carmen, Thiel, & Kurths, 2007) and served as an index of flexible behavior., Results and discussion. In general, findings indicate that (1) synthetic teams were most stable, followed by experimenter teams, who were moderately stable, and control teams, who were least stable; and (2) extreme stability and instability corresponded to lower levels of performance; experimenter teams performed best, followed by control teams and, then synthetic teams. Thus, synthetic agents could be made more effective if interventions were developed to enhance the flexibility and adaptive nature of HATs (Demir, 2017).',

      'In Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT), the development of a highly autonomous agent as a team member is difficult. Similar to human-human teaming, there are multiple dimensions of social behaviors that occur during HAT that must be accounted for within the development of the agent or system. One of these dimensions is team synchrony. In general, team synchrony is, when two systems (or two individuals in a team) are synchronized, resulting in their recurrences being dependent on each other. In order for a human-autonomy team to be synchronous the agent must communicate effectively (i.e., synchronize effectively) with its human team members. Thus, in this paper we present a conceptual discussion on what team synchrony is, how it occurs, and how to better develop it in HAT. To ground our discussion, we use our recent studies in which we empirically looked at team behaviors and team synchrony of HAT.',

      "A novel joint decision making paradigm for assessing team coordination was developed and tested using baseball infielders. Balls launched onto an infield at different trajectories were filmed using four video cameras that were each placed at one of the typical positions of the four infielders. Each participant viewed temporally occluded videos for one of the four positions and were asked to say either “ball” if they would attempt to field it or the name of the bag that they would cover. The evaluation of two experienced coaches was used to assign a group coordination score for each trajectory and group decision times were calculated. Thirty groups of 4 current college baseball players were: (i) teammates (players from same team/view from own position), (ii) non-teammates (players from different teams/view from own position), or (iii) scrambled teammates (players from same team/view not from own position). Teammates performed significantly better (i.e., faster and more coordinated decisions) than the other two groups, whereas scrambled teammates performed significantly better than non-teammates. These findings suggest that team coordination is achieved through both experience with one’s teammates’ responses to particular events (e.g., a ball hit up the middle) and one's own general action capabilities (e.g., running speed). The sensitivity of our joint decision making paradigm to group makeup provides support for its use as a method for studying team coordination.",

      'Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) have become one of the deadliest threats to military personnel, resulting in over 50% of American combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Identification of IED emplacement is conducted by mission payload operators (MPOs). Yet, experienced MPOs are limited in number, making MPO training a critical intervention. In this article, we implement a Cognitive Engineering Based on Expert Skill methodology to better understand how experienced MPOs identify the emplacement of IEDs for the purposes of improving training. First, expert knowledge was elicited through interviews and questionnaires to identify the types of perceptual cues used and how these cues are cognitively processed. Results indicate that there are many different static and dynamic cues that interact with each other over time and space. Using data from the interviews and questionnaires, an empirically grounded framework is presented that explains the cognitive process of IED emplacement detection. Using the overall findings and the framework, IED emplacement training scenarios were developed and built into a simulation.',

      "Historically, domains such as business intelligence would require a single analyst to engage with data, develop a model, answer operational questions, and predict future behaviors. However, as the problems and domains become more complex, organizations are employing teams of analysts to explore and model data to generate knowledge. Furthermore, given the rapid increase in data collection, organizations are struggling to develop practices for intelligence analysis in the era of big data. Currently, a variety of machine learning and data mining techniques are available to model data and to generate insights and predictions, and developments in the field of visual analytics have focused on how to effectively link data mining algorithms with interactive visuals to enable analysts to explore, understand, and interact with data and data models. Although studies have explored the role of single analysts in the visual analytics pipeline, little work has explored the role of teamwork and visual analytics in the analysis of big data. In this article, we present an experiment integrating statistical models, visual analytics techniques, and user experiments to study the role of teamwork in predictive analytics. We frame our experiment around the analysis of social media data for box office prediction problems and compare the prediction performance of teams, groups, and individuals. Our results indicate that a team's performance is mediated by the team's characteristics such as openness of individual members to others' positions and the type of planning that goes into the team's analysis. These findings have important implications for how organizations should create teams in order to make effective use of information from their analytic models.",

      'The chapter is organized as follows. First, we will review collaborative information seeking (CIS) literature with the purpose of explaining how CIS is conceptually viewed and studied, highlighting the lack of cognitive research. Next, we will present a set of cognitively oriented methodologies that can be used in CIS research. We present a metafamily of cognitive-elicitation techniques known as knowledge elicitation (KE). KE is a prominent set of methods and techniques for understanding both individual and team-level cognition. In the KE section, we will provide a high-level overview of the methodologies that fall under KE. We will then provide subsections outlining how to specifically use KE methods in CIS, concluding with the presentation of a case study. Next, we turn our attention to cognitive task analysis (CTA). CTA is a goal-specific approach (often employing KE methods) to understand cognition during the performance of a task. Similar to the KE section, we will provide an overview of CTA, present a section on how to apply CTA to CIS, and conclude with a case study. Finally, we present the living laboratory (LL) approach. The LL is a holistic cognitively based research approach that attempts to understand cognition in context, further understand it in the lab, and then develop technologies/recommendations to improve performance in the real-world context. Sections relating to how the LL can be applied to CIS, and a case study will be presented.',

      'In contemporary society, teamwork is prominent as a critical component in many complex environments. Much of the success of teamwork is coupled with both team cognition and the contextual surround that a team is required to perform in. Over the last thirty years there have been various formulations of team simulations that represent team cognition and the context in various ways—some more beneficial than others. This paper examines numerous practical considerations, lessons learned, and insights developed over specific team simulations that our research group has engaged with over the years.',

      'Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is of growing importance in the information sciences and human–computer interaction (HCI) research communities. Current research has primarily focused on examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational or other settings and developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. As we continue to develop a better understanding of the interactional aspects of CIS, we need also start to examine the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, we need to understand CIS from a team cognition perspective. To examine how team cognition develops during CIS, we conducted a study using observations and interviews of student teams engaged in colocated CIS tasks in a laboratory setting. We found that a variety of awareness mechanisms play a key role in the development of team cognition during CIS. Specifically, we identify that search, information, and social methods of awareness are critical to developing team cognition during CIS. We discuss why awareness is important for team cognition, how team cognition comprises both individual and team-level cognitive activities, and the importance of examining both interaction and cognition to truly understand team cognition.',

      'Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an important and complex treatment modality for a variety of hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. Although outcomes of patients who have undergone HCT and require care in intensive care units (ICUs) have improved over time, mortality rates remain high and there are significant associated costs. Lack of a team-based approach to care, especially during critical illness, is detrimental to patient autonomy and satisfaction, and to team morale, ultimately leading to poor quality of care. In this manuscript, we describe the case of a patient who had undergone HCT and was in the ICU setting, where inconsistent team interaction among the various stakeholders delivering care resulted in a lack of shared goals and poor outcomes. Team cognition is cognitive processing at the team level through interactions among team members and is reflected in dynamic communication and coordination behaviors. Although the patient received multidisciplinary care as needed in a medically complicated case, a lack of team cognition and, particularly, inconsistent communication among the dynamic teams caring for the patient, led to mixed messages being delivered with high-cost implications for the health-care system and the family. This article highlights concepts and recommendations that begin a necessary in-depth assessment of implications for clinical care and initiate a research agenda that examines the effects of team cognition on HCT teams, and, more generally, critical care of the patient with cancer.',

      'Extreme environments often profoundly impact one’s cognition and subsequently the ability to make accurate and correct decisions. Although we are beginning to understand how these environments impact individual and team cognition, more specific work conducted in real extreme environments is needed to further understand this relationship. In this paper, we present data collected in the extreme environment of gas ballooning. Recently, the Two Eagles gas ballooning project set two absolute world records: longest duration in a gas balloon and longest distance in a gas balloon. During this project, our research team was able to collect cognitive abilities data and data on the effects of multiple stressors in the environment. We present the overall project along with some insights from the data. We also highlight lessons learned from attempting to collect data in an extreme environment.',

The two pilots set both the record for the longest duration and for the longest distance in a gas balloon. The system extended far beyond the balloon and the two pilots.

This paper provides a historical foundation to various elements of human-agent collaboration, leading to the identification of research needs and challenges that are often present when teamwork is seen from the vantage point of cognitive augmentation. A broad research framework consisting of four meshed phases derives from the historical foundation and research needs and challenges to help integrate multifarious considerations involving information, technology, people, and environment is presented. Examples and lessons learned associated with each phase are provided to help articulate requisite bottlenecks and tradeoffs that inevitability arise when agents, aids, and interfaces are purposefully human-centered in their approach.

      'Project overview. The current project is part of a larger effort that focuses on Human-Automation Teaming (HAT) interaction in the context of the development, integration, and validation of a computational cognitive model that acts as a full-fledged synthetic teammate for a three-agent Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) ground control crew. Our most recent effort looked at team process and team performance within the HAT. In order to be considered a team player, the synthetic teammate must be able to communicate and coordinate with its human teammates and do so in a subtle manner (Demir et al., 2016). In this task, there were three different and interdependent team members: 1) Air Vehicle Operator (AVO) ? controls the UAS?s heading, altitude, and airspeed; 2) Data Exploitation, Mission Planning, and Communications (DEMPC) ? provides a dynamic flight plan as well as speed and altitude restrictions; and 3) Payload Operator (PLO) ? monitors sensor equipment, negotiates with the AVO, and takes photographs of target waypoints. The communication within a three-agent UAS team occurred over a text-based communications system. In this research, there were three conditions which are differentiated by the AVO role: 1) the Synthetic - the synthetic teammate was assigned the AVO role; 2) the Control - the AVO was an inexperienced human participant; 3) the Experimenter - the AVO was one of the experimenters who was experienced with the task. The experimenter AVO asked questions of other team members to ensure timely and adaptive passing of information at target waypoints. In this current study, the coordination among the team members occurs at each target waypoint and requires a specific sequence of information passing for an optimum team performance (Cooke, Gorman, Duran,  team performance that is a combination of mission variables, including the rate of successful target photographs, time spent in alarm and warning states (for each individual), and the critical waypoint acquisition rate; and target processing efficiency took into account the time spent inside a target waypoint to get a good photo.Results and discussion. In general, findings indicate that synthetic AVOs perform more poorly than control AVOs in terms of team performance. Synthetic teams perform as well at the mission level as control teams. However, in terms of target processing efficiency, synthetic teams perform poorer than control teams. In terms of team process, synthetic teams demonstrate interaction patterns corresponding to more pulling of information than pushing with little change over time. In summary, these results indicate that there is a strong potential for using synthetic team member as a teammate in real world tasks and for training.',

      'Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) are steadily increasing in their presence and role in the Military’s overall strategic operational picture. The benefits of RPAS are apparent, ranging from saving time, money, and lives. Yet, the utilization of RPAS is still very challenging in many different aspects. Teams have become a central focus of RPAS due to their many benefits. Yet, teamwork is challenging and the RPAS community must continue to attempt to understand how to support it. A specific aspect of teamwork that has proven over the years to be of paramount importance is team cognition. In this paper, we discuss how team cognition needs to be considered during the development of collaborative and proactive RPAS decision support. We highlight the concept of team cognition accounting for multiple perspectives, outline an integrative perspective of team cognition for the RPAS domain, and conclude by outlining multiple design objectives for utilizing team cognition as a mechanism for RPAS decision support.',

      'Background: The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that annually there are approximately 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). Hospitals have implemented multidisciplinary teams trained in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) to provide care during these events. Outcome measures of these team’s effectiveness are typically mortality rates at discharge and reduction of unplanned cardiac arrest occurring outside of the ICU. Neither is a sensitive measure of team effectiveness. Methods: Using a retrospective analysis of 10 simulated code blue events we developed a metric of team effectiveness for code blue teams that also identifies specific teamwork weaknesses. Results: The new ASU-Mayo metric was highly correlated with Mayo high performance team scale (MHPTS) (r (6) = .71), team emergency assessment measure (TEAM) (r (6) = .84), and the observational skill-based assessment tool for resuscitation (OSCAR) (r (6) = .89) metrics as well as the ratings of the subject matter experts (r (6) = .88). Conclusions: We developed a team performance metric that allows for the identification of performance gaps therefore, can allow for targeted intervention with the intention of providing trainees richer feedback on performance. Also, it will generate quantitative assessments of the value of mock code exercises and can be used to evaluate interventions. Our understanding of teamwork during a simulated code blue event was also enhanced.',

      'If synthetic teammates are to be considered “team players”, then they must be better equipped to handle the subtleties of communication and coordination with their human teammates. In this study, the team communication behaviors of a human-automation team were analyzed for the identification of which are the best predictors of team performance. The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method was used to select the team communication behaviors that were the best predictors of team performance and, in the end, 16 such role related communication behaviors (at both the role and condition level) were included in the final model. Findings indicate that in general, negatively perceived communication behaviors are predictors of negative team performance. Through this study, we also learned that even when human team members follow their optimal and expected communication behaviors when communicating with a synthetic teammate, these behaviors are still predictors of negative team performance. This finding holds important future considerations: even if human team members are properly communicating with a synthetic teammate, the errors and lack of human-like behavior on the part of the latter can still result in a negative team performance.',

      'Sports are an important aspect of almost every culture and have also helped to define what most people consider a team. Like sports, teams permeate society. Teamwork that occurs within sports teams generally consists of physical coordination and cognitive processing. The interaction between physical coordination and cognitive processing at the team level or team cognition drives teamwork. Team cognition is a rich research area, yet studies of team cognition and team sports have been minimal. Team cognition has been studied from one of two different perspectives: information processing/shared knowledge and ecological. Though each perspective is useful, most research on team cognition work has taken the information processing/shared knowledge approach. In this chapter, we review each perspective, and assess each in regards to the context of team sports. We conclude by recommending an integrative perspective, utilizing aspects of both team cognition perspectives, to study team cognition during team sports.',

      'A synthetic teammate based on ACT-R cognitive architecture has been developed to function as an Air Vehicle Operator in the context of a three-agent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) ground control team taking part in studies in a Synthetic Task Environment (STE). In order for the synthetic teammate to function as team player with human teammates, it needs to skillfully handle the subtleties of team communication and coordination. Data from early synthetic teammate interactions with two human teammates are presented here to illustrate team communication and coordination challenges for the synthetic teammate. In turn, the synthetic teammate limitations have highlighted the intricacies involved in effective teamwork. Communication, though a terrifically challenging problem in itself, is only a foundation for coordinated teamwork or interacting as a team player.',

Yet, the scope and breadth of IA is growing and evolving for many different reasons. IA is more dynamic and multi-faceted than it has ever been. The process of IA is changing due to expanding sensor data, new methods of work, new technologies, and new challenges. In addition, the scope and context of IA is greater than ever, including focuses such as healthcare, climate change, and cyber security (to name a few). In response to these changes, a few key questions emerge.

One particular example of this is the continued efforts towards understanding developmental differences in co-located and distributed mediums. Both of these settings are imperative and critical to teamwork. As individuals become more mobile and less physically connected, supporting teamwork in distributed settings is becoming more and more important. In this paper, we present a study focused on the development of a team mental model (TMM) of collaborative information seeking (CIS) in a distributed setting. The study’s findings provide insights into how a TMM specific to CIS develops within a distributed medium, highlighting specific aspects that help and hurt development. Concluding thoughts are presented with the aim to further understand how TMMs develop differently within the contexts of co-located and distributed mediums.',

      'The importance of collaborative information seeking (CIS) during team decision-making is starting to be examined within the human factors community. Without the ability to collaborate to seek and retrieve information, a team cannot make accurate decisions. One area of particular importance to CIS is individual and team cognition. Through previous research, we know that cognition is critical to the performance of many collaborative efforts. Yet, there has been little research on the relationship of cognition to CIS. Consequently, appropriate methods to use and how to use them have not been clearly identified. One useful approach to understanding cognition during CIS is to implement a concept mapping methodology. In this paper, we discuss concept mapping and utilize it in a laboratory study focused on understanding the role of cognition during CIS. Through analysis of CIS oriented individual and team concept maps, we gained insights into how people cognitively perceive CIS.',

      'Human Factors has informed both research and practice for over 100 years [1]. In this time, many theories, methods, and design practices have been implemented. As a result, the way Human Factors as a discipline has been conceptualized and put into practice has undergone numerous changes. Human Factors, at its heart is the idea that technology influences humans, and that humans influence the performance efficiency and effectiveness of technology, and other humans. Recent approaches to Human Factors have created multiple baseline assumptions on understanding human system interaction. For example, McNeese et al. [2] identified four systems design paradigms wherein each produce a qualitatively different outcome: Technology-Centered, User-Centered, Data-Centered, Group-Centered. Although there is value and truth in each approach, individually each theme limits its scope by deemphasizing contributions from the others. Because isomorphic approaches abound in the field, this paper theorizes a more optimal approach to contemporary human factors - The Living Laboratory Framework – that posits a wholistic perspective addressing various underling parameters in complex problem solving and innovative design. In this contemporary approach, the theory–problems–practice becomes highly integrated, reflecting unique and dynamic methods to create human-system integration. Examples are provided in the domains of cyber operations and police cognition to demonstrate the value of this approach.',

      'For most people, the concept of a team is most often associated with the context of sports. Sports permeate our society and are a critical form of entertainment for many. Fans of sports teams intently watch their team, often thinking little about the many complexities involved in any given team sport. Yet, the complexities are many, and one serious area that is historically understudied is the development of team cognition within sports teams. Sports teams are dynamic, in that they rely on both physical and cognitive dimensions of teamwork to be effective. A sports team does not only focus on strategy or developing a game plan to beat their opponent (cognitive), they must also execute this on the field of play (perceptual motor). The integration of both cognition and physical execution is dependent on the development of team cognition. Team cognition allows team members to develop an understanding of their overall strategic goals and implement them on the field. Thus, the development of team cognition within sports has the potential to greatly improve performance. Yet, to fully understand how team cognition develops within sports teams and its impact on and off the field, we need to study the developmental process more within this specific context. As with any domain specific area, conceptual/theoretical approaches and research methodologies must be identified as meaningful for the selected research context. This paper presents and describes theoretical approaches that are useful for studying sports and team cognition. Specifically, this paper explores and describes the theory of Interactive Team Cognition [1] as a perspective and approach to studying the development and implications of team cognition within team sports. As previously noted, sports are a highly dynamic activity and dependent on many functions (communication, coordination, collaboration) to be effective. The theory of Interactive Team Cognition directly aligns with these functions, acknowledging that team cognition is an activity (sports is) that is highly dependent on the context that it is occurring in. In addition, the theory also states that it is best to study and measure team cognition when the team is the unit of analysis. In this paper, we also present methods for how researchers can study team cognition within sports teams. The paper concludes with an overview of the potential to study team cognition within sports teams using the aforementioned approaches and methods.',

      'Team decision-making is a process composed of many activities. One important activity is collaborative information seeking (CIS). CIS takes place when “two or more individuals work together to seek needed information in order to satisfy a goal” (Karunakaran & Reddy, 2012). Consequently, CIS can play an important role in team decision-making. Current CIS research has focused on (1) examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational and other settings and (2) developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. However, most CIS research has overlooked the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, there is little research examining CIS from a team cognitive perspective. Often, the development of team cognition positively improves the team decision-making process (Cooke et al., 2003). Specifically, the development of team mental models, a team cognitive construct, has often been identified as a way to help teams complete their work (Lim & Klein, 2006). However, the relationship of CIS and team cognition has never fully been explored. In this dissertation, my four main research objectives were to (a) explore how teams approach CIS; (b) develop a conceptual understanding of team cognition during CIS; (c) understand the impact and affect of a co-located and distributed setting on team’s CIS approaches and the development of team cognition, and (d) develop design guidelines for information technologies that will support multiple CIS approaches and the development of team cognition during CIS. To meet my research objectives, I conducted two separate qualitative laboratory studies of undergraduate student teams engaged in multiple CIS tasks. The first study focused on co-located, synchronous CIS. In this study, I utilized qualitative methods such as cognitive interviews, observations, and concept mapping to examine how teams approached CIS and to identify if and how team cognition developed during CIS activities. The second study examined teams using a collaborative system in a distributed, synchronous CIS environment. The second study employed cognitive interviewing to investigate CIS approaches and team cognition in the distributed environment. Through these studies, I make contributions to three different research fields – (1) Human Factors, (2) Information Sciences, and (3) Computer Supported Cooperative Work. Specifically, I (1) identify different approaches that teams take to CIS, (2) explain the role and development of team cognition in CIS, and (3) describe how teams approach CIS and develop team cognition in both the co-located and distributed environments. Through this research, I hope to further our empirical understanding of CIS especially in regards to cognition. I also hope to provide some design guidance for the development of more effective CIS tools that account for the role of team cognition.',

      'Team decision-making (TDM) is composed of many activities. One important aspect of TDM is information seeking, particularly collaborative information seeking (CIS). Within CIS research, the role of team cognition and the development of team mental models (TMMs) have not been well-studied. In this paper, we examine the development of TMMs during CIS activities. Utilizing qualitative knowledge elicitation methods, we conducted an exploratory laboratory-based study of student teams working on CIS tasks. We report on how the teams describe TMM development, the teamwork and taskwork aspects of the TMM, and the attributes supporting TMM development. The results highlight that the process of TMM development during CIS is similar to TMM development research reported in other studies. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to attempt to understand the role of team cognition in CIS and describe the development of a TMM specific to CIS.',

      'Teamwork has become one of the hallmarks of emergency crisis management (ECM). Success in managing emergency situations is highly dependent on teams working together to accomplish prioritized goals. Therefore, given the importance of teamwork, team cognition has been realized as an important component to address the emerging complexity, extreme workload, and uncertain conditions that can underlie emergency response. Many variables affect teams and their subsequent cognition. Understanding the effects of awareness, attention, temporality, common ground, team mental model development, and culture on team cognition provides insight into effective and efficient management of emergencies. As a research group, for more than a decade, we have studied team cognition within the context of ECM through the basis of simulations using the NeoCITIES platform. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences using the NeoCITIES platform to conduct basic team cognitive research and share our visions for future research trajectories for the greater Human Factors community.',

      'Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are used by a wide variety of users. However, current research on the design and use of the EMR primarily focuses on clinical users such as physicians and nurses. While it is important to understand EMR use by clinicians, there is also a need to understand how non-clinicians use these systems because of the important role they play in the patient-care process. In this note, we present results of an ethnographic field study on the use and perceptions of EMR systems by non-clinicians in an emergency department. We then discuss design implications that can improve the system usability and strengthen the empowerment of these non-clinicians.',

      'The preparation of next generation analyst work requires alternative levels of understanding and new methodological departures from the way current work transpires. Current work practices typically do not provide a comprehensive approach that emphasizes the role of and interplay between (a) cognition, (b) emergent activities in a shared situated context, and (c) collaborative teamwork. In turn, effective and efficient problem solving fails to take place, and practice is often composed of piecemeal, techno-centric tools that isolate analysts by providing rigid, limited levels of understanding of situation awareness. This coupled with the fact that many analyst activities are classified produces a challenging situation for researching such phenomena and designing and evaluating systems to support analyst cognition and teamwork. Through our work with cyber, image, and intelligence analysts we have realized that there is more required of researchers to study human-centered designs to provide for analyst’s needs in a timely fashion. This paper identifies and describes how The Living Laboratory Framework can be utilized as a means to develop a comprehensive, human-centric, and problem-focused approach to next generation analyst work, design, and training. We explain how the framework is utilized for specific cases in various applied settings (e.g., crisis management analysis, image analysis, and cyber analysis) to demonstrate its value and power in addressing an area of utmost importance to our national security. Attributes of analyst work settings are delineated to suggest potential design affordances that could help improve cognitive activities and awareness. Finally, the paper puts forth a research agenda for the use of the framework for future work that will move the analyst profession in a viable manner to address the concerns identified.',

      'In case of emergencies (e.g., earthquakes, flooding), rapid responses are needed in order to address victims’\nrequests for help. Social media used around crises involves self-organizing behavior that can produce accurate\nresults, often in advance of official communications. This allows affected population to send tweets or text\nmessages, and hence, make them heard. The ability to classify tweets and text messages automatically, together\nwith the ability to deliver the relevant information to the appropriate personnel are essential for enabling the\npersonnel to timely and efficiently work to address the most urgent needs, and to understand the emergency\nsituation better. In this study, we developed a reusable information technology infrastructure, called Enhanced\nMessaging for the Emergency Response Sector (EMERSE). The components of EMERSE are: (i) an iPhone\napplication; (ii) a Twitter crawler component; (iii) machine translation; and (iv) automatic message\nclassification. While each component is important in itself and deserves a detailed analysis, in this paper we\nfocused on the automatic classification component, which classifies and aggregates tweets and text messages\nabout the Haiti disaster relief so that they can be easily accessed by non-governmental organizations, relief\nworkers, people in Haiti, and their friends and families.',

      'Various studies in the team cognition literature suggest the primacy of face-to-face interaction over various forms of electronically-mediated communication. Theories supporting distributed cognition and anchored perception indicate that select forms of communication media may create impoverished shared mental models that fail to transfer understanding across team members. Of particular interest in this study is the perceived value of a new virtual communication medium, Second Life, as compared to face-to-face or auditory teleconferencing in a team task. Team members perceived the face-to-face modality to better aid the team than Second Life or the auditory teleconferencing mode, yet the results show an experience-based bias toward face-to-face interaction. Team success was rated worst for the auditory condition. Discussion of these results are developed in terms of their impact on theory, practice, and applications. Additional data analyses are suggested that will yield in-depth understanding of Jasper team performance.',
